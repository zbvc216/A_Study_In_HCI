# A_Study_In_HCI
Final Year Project

Running Website 1:
	Within the folder named "Website 1" you will find 3 subfolders: "Personal Website", "Personal Website - Alt" and "Personal Website - Greyscale"
	Each of these will have a file "index.html" opening this with the browser of your choice will allow you to view the website and navigate it entirely.

Running Website 2:
	Within the folder named "Website 1" you will find 3 subfolders: Purple Website" and "Purple Website - Greyscale"
	Each of these will have a file "index.html" opening this with the browser of your choice will allow you to view the website and navigate it entirely.

Running the App:
	Within the folder named "Diary App" you will find all the Android Studio files.
	Opening \app\src\java\com\james\green\journal\MainActivity.java will bring you to the class which you can run the app from.
	The emulator can be chosen within Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html) I used a Nexus 5 during development.
	The app should launch as soon as the emulator has loaded, otherwise in the app menu it will be shown as Journalate.
